ISSUE 

On Module 7 Deliverable 2 (Latest title is not getting displayed in the mentorship_Eligibility)

1) titles table is not sorted properly based on (emp_no & from_date)
so, for some employees the previous title is present as first row and the latest as second row

2) As we are taking the from_date from department_employee table(it has only the first joining date in from_date). So when DISTINCT is trying to fetch the unique record, its considering the different title as all the column values are same except title.

FIX:

1) Sort the titles table based on Employee and to_date in Descending order.

2) Join the tables and use DISTINCT to fetch the unique employees. 

3) To fetch the latest title of the employee, we have to sort the employees based on emp_no & from _date of titles in Descending.

SELECT * 
INTO titles_new
from titles
ORDER BY emp_no, to_date DESC;

SELECT count(emp_no) from titles_new;

DROP TABLE mentorship_eligibility;

-- SELECT DISTINCT ON(t.emp_no) e.emp_no, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.birth_date, de.from_date, de.to_date, t.title
-- INTO mentorship_eligibility
SELECT DISTINCT ON (e.emp_no) e.emp_no, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.birth_date, de.from_date, de.to_date, t.title
INTO mentorship_eligibility
FROM employees AS e
JOIN dept_employees AS de
ON (e.emp_no = de.emp_no)
JOIN titles_new AS t
ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no	
WHERE (de.to_date = '9999-01-01' AND (e.birth_date BETWEEN '1965-01-01' AND '1965-12-31'))
ORDER BY e.emp_no, t.from_date DESC;

SELECT * from mentorship_eligibility;

SELECT * from mentorship_eligibility where emp_no = 10095; 

SELECT count(emp_no) from mentorship_eligibility;

SELECT * from titles_new where emp_no = 10095;
